Early outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by trade routes land and sea to Russia in 1817 later to the rest of Europe and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world. Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years with the seventh pandemic originating in Indonesia in 1961.",

It killed 150000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920 perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow in England was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.",

In terms of human technological history the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the Atomic Age and the resulting danger of mutually-assured destruction. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances the German Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires against the British Russian and French Empires was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a domino effect of alliances triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times.",

Having less sleep than this is common among humans even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state including reduced memory fatigue aggression and bodily discomfort. During sleep humans dream. In dreaming humans experience sensory images and sounds in a sequence which the dreamer usually perceives more as an apparent participant than as an observer.

When combined with its quantity water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point unlike e. g. carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere as the water condenses and exits primarily in the troposphere the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide  and methane being non-polar rise above water vapor. The absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth's emission to space and thus the planetary greenhouse effect. This greenhouse forcing is directly observable via distinct spectral features versus water vapor and observed to be rising with rising levels. Conversely adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact which is why methane rising then oxidizing to and two water molecules and jet traffic have disproportionately high warming effects.",

He was removed from school and by October 1659 he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth where his mother widowed by now for a second time attempted to make a farmer of him. He hated farming.

Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force SHAEF. General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion. On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions with airborne descents by three additional divisions to allow operations on a wider front and speed up the capture of Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June. Eventually thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy twenty-two US twelve British three Canadian one Polish and one French totalling over a million troops all under overall British command.",

During her brief career she wrote novels treatises a travel narrative a history of the French Revolution a conduct book and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" 1792 in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.",

         "Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains. Thereafter he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to \"hadith\" and Muslim history after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the Battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken the Quran was recorded on tablets bones and the wide flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation. \"Sahih al-Bukhari\" narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as \"Sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell\" and Aisha reported \"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead as the Inspiration was over.\" Muhammad's first revelation according to the Quran was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \"one mighty in power\" the one who \"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was distant two bows' length or even nearer.\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood. The Quran describes Muhammad as \"\"ummi\"\" which is traditionally interpreted as \"illiterate\" but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as Al-Tabari maintained that the term induced two meanings first the inability to read or write in general second the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures but they gave priority to the first meaning. Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning of \"\"ummi\"\"—they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.",

They often visit shallow reefs harbors and canals creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans its bite rate is low. It ranks second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans behind only the great white shark. Typically three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii but they are rarely fatal one notable survivor of such an attack is surfing champion Bethany Hamilton who lost her left arm at age 13 to a tiger shark in 2003. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim surf and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.",

The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 13 ton 13.76-tonne bell. The second bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses with crowds cheering its progress it was then pulled up to the Clock Tower's belfry a feat that took 18 hours. It is tall and diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859 in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager George Mears the horologist Denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified. For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired. To make the repair a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired. Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until \"Great Paul\" a 16 ton 17 tonne bell currently hung in St Paul's Cathedral was cast in 1881.",

As part of the revolutionary wave of protests in the Middle East and North Africa following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia the Bahraini protests were initially aimed at achieving greater political freedom and equality for the majority Shia population and expanded to a call to end the monarchy of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa following a deadly night raid on 17 February 2011 against protesters at the Pearl Roundabout in Manama known locally as Bloody Thursday.",

In the first game the character was portrayed by Lake with Timothy Gibbs and James McCaffrey later taking over the role and consistently voiced by McCaffrey. Mark Wahlberg portrayed Max in the film adaptation. The first game in the series presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view while the sequel \"\" alternates between his and that of the femme fatale character Mona Sax.",

         "Poetry as an art form predates written text. The earliest poetry is believed to have been recited or sung employed as a way of remembering oral history genealogy and law. Poetry is often closely related to musical traditions and the earliest poetry exists in the form of hymns such as the work of Sumerian priestess Enheduanna and other types of song such as chants. As such poetry is a verbal art. Many of the poems surviving from the ancient world are recorded prayers or stories about religious subject matter but they also include historical accounts instructions for everyday activities love songs and fiction. Many scholars particularly those researching the Homeric tradition and the oral epics of the Balkans suggest that early writing shows clear traces of older oral traditions including the use of repeated phrases as building blocks in larger poetic units. A rhythmic and repetitious form would make a long story easier to remember and retell before writing was available as an aide-memoire. Thus many ancient works from the Vedas 1700 - 1200 BC to the \"Odyssey\" 800 - 675 BC appear to have been composed in poetic form to aid memorization and oral transmission in prehistoric and ancient societies. Poetry appears among the earliest records of most literate cultures with poetic fragments found on early monoliths runestones and stelae.",

         "In modern humans the vermiform appendix is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze cellulose and similar indigestible plant materials. Some herbivorous animals such as rabbits have a terminal vermiform appendix and cecum that apparently bear patches of tissue with immune functions and may also be important in maintaining the composition of intestinal flora. It does not however seem to have much digestive function if any and is not present in all herbivores even those with large caeca. As shown in the accompanying pictures however the human appendix typically is about comparable to that of the rabbit's in size though the caecum is reduced to a single bulge where the ileum empties into the colon. Some carnivorous animals may have appendices too but seldom have more than vestigial caeca. In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion though that is unlikely to be a novel function given the presence of vermiform appendices in many herbivores. Intestinal bacterial populations entrenched in the appendix may support quick re-establishment of the flora of the large intestine after an illness poisoning or after an antibiotic treatment depletes or otherwise causes harmful changes to the bacterial population of the colon. A 2013 study however refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. It is widely present in euarchontoglires a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates and has also evolved independently in the diprotodont marsupials monotremes and is highly diverse in size and shape which could suggest it is not vestigial. Researchers deduce that the appendix has the ability to protect good bacteria in the gut. That way when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep the person healthy.",

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998 with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011 and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules structural trusses solar arrays radiators docking ports experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets and American Space Shuttles.",

The first named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season Chanchu formed on May 8 in the vicinity of the Federated States of Micronesia and progressed westward. It gradually intensified into a tropical storm and later severe tropical storm before moving through the Philippines. On May 13 Chanchu entered the South China Sea and became a typhoon according to the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA. Warm waters and favorable outflow allowed the storm to quickly intensify to peak maximum sustained winds of 175 kmh 110 mph on May 15. Around that time the typhoon turned sharply to the north toward southeastern China. Chanchu weakened as it curved to the northeast making landfall near Shantou Guangdong on May 17 as a severe tropical storm. The government of China considered Chanchu the earliest typhoon to make landfall in the province. On the next day the storm emerged into the East China Sea becoming extratropical on May 19 before dissipating west of Kyushu.",

It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes the possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to prove that the proposition is either true or false. It also does not allow for the possibility that the answer is unknowable only knowable in the future or neither completely true nor completely false. In debates appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof. In research low-power experiments are subject to false negatives there would have been an observable effect if there had been a larger sample size or better experimental design and false positives there was an observable effect however this was a coincidence due purely to random chance or the events correlate but there is no cause-effect relationship.

Early outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by trade routes land and sea to Russia in 1817 later to the rest of Europe and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world. Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years with the seventh pandemic originating in Indonesia in 1961.",

         "Since it became widespread in the 19th century cholera has killed tens of millions of people. In Russia alone between 1847 and 1851 more than one million people perished of the disease. It killed 150000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920 perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow in England was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.",

         "World War I occurred from 1914 to 1918. In terms of human technological history the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the Atomic Age and the resulting danger of mutually-assured destruction. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances the German Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires against the British Russian and French Empires was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a domino effect of alliances triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times.",

Galen stated that \"cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins\".

Early outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by trade routes land and sea to Russia in 1817 later to the rest of Europe and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world. Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years with the seventh pandemic originating in Indonesia in 1961.",

It killed 150000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920 perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow in England was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.",

In terms of human technological history the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the Atomic Age and the resulting danger of mutually-assured destruction. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances the German Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires against the British Russian and French Empires was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a domino effect of alliances triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times.",

Galen stated that \"cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins\".
